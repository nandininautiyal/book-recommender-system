# book-recommender-system

This project implements a book recommender system that provides personalized book suggestions based on a user's favorite book. By leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the system identifies and recommends five books that are similar to the input book.

How It Works
The user inputs their favorite book.
The system compares the input book to a database of books.
Using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the system finds the five most similar books.
The recommendations are displayed to the user.
